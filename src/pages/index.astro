                    I'm a Business major who graduated from the University of the West Indies
                    in 2018. I've been programming for most of my life, but moved into doing it professionally
                    when a friend of mine needed extra hands on deck with his start-up.

                    Learning is my addiction. My programming journey started many years ago with Pascal,
                    before then moving on to C, C++, Python, and, most recently, Javascript and Typescript. 
                    I enjoy learning about new languages, technologies, and frameworks.
