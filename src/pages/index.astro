                    I'm a freelance developer who specializes in developing mobile and web applications
                    with Flutter.

                    I love learning new things. Even though I primarily work with Flutter nowadays, My programming journey started many years ago with Pascal,
                    before then moving on to C, C++, Python, and, most recently, Javascript and Typescript along with Dart and Flutter.
