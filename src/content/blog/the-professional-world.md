# We in the big leagues now

It's been quite a long time since my last blog post, but I haven't given up. I've actually started
my own company called Viridian Software and I've got my first real client! While I'd like to spill the beans and get real detailed about what I've been working on, the client is serious about their privacy so I'll have to keep it vague. What I can say is that it's a headless application and I'm responsible for building the frontend with Flutter. 

Before this most of my frontend experience was in React, but I had been using Flutter as part of a project for my day job. There's a stark contrast between building an application on your own as a solo-developer and working on a project as part of a team. It's a lot more difficult to keep the code clean when you're on your own. Oh, sure, it starts of all well and good and you're writing code that would make Uncle Bob blush, but then the time crunch sets in and you start moving fast and breakin' things and before you know it you're left with a mountain of technical debt that needs to be repaid.

Needless to say it's been quite an interesting couple of months. I think I'll do a blog post comparing my experience with Flutter vs React next. Until then, ciao!
