# What I've been working on

Hello! Welcome, bienvenue and valkommen to an update on what I've been up to for the past few weeks. In addition to my normal day job which is, *barely*, keeping the lights on, I've had the pleasure to be working on an entire fullstack application. By myself. Well, not entirely by myself. Thank goodness. My good friends, Paul, and Jairaj have been great helpers and motivators.

I've got to say, working a full time job and solo-developing a fullstack application, whose calculations and logic mostly deal with **dates**, has been a bit of a pain, but it's definitely provided me with an opportunity to approach software development from all angles. Everything from identifying the real problem that needs to be solved, how to create and maintain a positive relationship with clients, the importance of data modeling, and how much learning never really ends.
