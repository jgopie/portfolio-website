# My Experience with javascript

Where do I even begin. Javascript is an experience unlike any other. A bit of history: my first taste of programming came in the mid 2000s with Pascal in secondary school, then C and C++ through my first few years in University before I made the, poor, decision to switch degrees from Computer Science to Business Management. Python was easy to pick up. (Note: If you've come upon this post then Hi! but this isn't finished yet :>)
